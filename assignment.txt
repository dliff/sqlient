The assignment is to build a simple SQL client for PostgreSQL using the technologies that we use internally: Node, React (using React hooks), and Redux. It should be a simple web app served from an Express server with whatever HTTP API endpoints you think are necessary to execute queries. In terms of the app layout, you should be able to connect to a database using a few inputs for the required credentials and a button to confirm the credentials. This should redirect you to the main SQL client page where the list of tables is on a left sidebar, and then a text area where you can edit the query. There should be a button you can click to run the query, which will show the results underneath the editor. You can decide how you want to display the results, it doesn't have to account for big data or anything like that. In terms of styling, we use emotion to style our components so please use that. You don't need to do anything super fancy with the css, just the basics for positioning and maybe making things a little nicer than native html styling.

Any extra features you think would be nice are definitely good to see in these kinds of assignments, assuming you have the time to do so. Please let me know about these features so that I can look out for them while I go over it. Also let me know if you have any questions.
